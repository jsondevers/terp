Some of the courses I've taken at UMD, mostly including the classes that had projects/code that I'd like to potentially look back to.

After I finish my spring semester, I'll provide a review of each course and my recommendations for future students.

Note that I didn't include:

- STICs (student initiated courses)
  - i also taught two STICs, one on the coding interview, another on git
- Math courses
- GenEds
- QUEST Honors Program courses
